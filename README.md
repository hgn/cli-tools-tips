# Command Line Interface Tools Tips

## Vim

### General Tips

- never ever leave vim, stay within vim all the time. `<CTRL>-Z` to suspend
	vim, execute shell command and `fg` to foregrounding into vim again. This
	will keep your vim history/state intact. If required open additional
	terminals to do things. But repeat: never ever leave vim
